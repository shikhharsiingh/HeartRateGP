# HeartRateGP
A Gaussian Process (GP) model for analyzing and predicting heart rate trends from wearable data. This project uses GP regression to model heart rate dynamics during workouts, capturing patterns and variability in real-time. Ideal for exploring probabilistic modeling in fitness and health analytics.
